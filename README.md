# <h2>OneViewLeadsUiPath</h2>

Hello there!

This automation was created for my girlfriend. She works with a database of potential new clients. But the website that she uses doesn't have a filter options to sort only e-mails that got rejected or moved to spam. Also, as there's always 1000+ entries, she needed to manually search for these and delete one by one.

My automation creates a .xlsx file with two columns ('rejected' and 'spam') for record purpose, then it searchs and deletes these e-mail entries.

For security, I removed the credential activites.
